#### Nemo ####

Nemo is a custom Verilog compiler backend target module to be used along side
the open source frontend Verilog compiler tool Icarus Verilog
(http://iverilog.icarus.com/). Nemo allows an IC designer to create signal
dependency graphs for any signal(s) in the design after it has been synthesized
and mapped.

Nemo is initially invoked by the Icarus Verilog (IVL) frontend compiler and
interacts with the data structures created by IVL via the IVL API defined by in
the "ivl_target.h" header file. In order to use Nemo, one must first
build/install IVL before building/installing Nemo.

Nemo takes as input a Verilog netlist (the output from a Verilog synthesis tool)
and a Verilog netlist describing the standard cell modules used for synthesis.
Nemo identifies critical signals in the input netlist based on a regular
expression (defined in the "nemo.h" file) match and generates a signal
dependency graph (to a graph depth also defined in the "nemo.h" file) to
identify which signals in a design have the potential to influence a critical
signal. Nemo outputs the critical signal dependency graph in DOT graph
description language file.

Example Nemo input files, a Verilog netlist and a standard cell Verilog netlist,
are available in the "netlists/" directory. Example Nemo output files, a DOT
file and a PDF visual representation of the DOT file, are available in the
"graphs/" directory.

#### Cloning Git Repositories ####

1. Clone IVL  Repo --> git clone git://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog.git 2.
Clone Nemo Repo --> git clone

#### Building/Installing IVL ####

Detailed instructions on this process can be found here:
http://iverilog.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_Guide, but a summary is provided
below.

1. cd iverilog 2. sh autoconf.sh 3. ./configure --prefix=<full path of iverilog
directory> 4. make install 5. cd ..

#### Building/Installing Nemo ####

1. cd nemo 2. edit Makefile variable "BASE_IVERILOG_DIR" (line 1) to be "<full
path of iverilog directory>" 3. edit Makefile variable "EXEC_DIR" (line 1) to be
"<full path of iverilog directory>/lib/ivl" 4. make all


#### Running Nemo on Sample Netlist ####

-run "make run" inside tgtnemo directory

- or -

-run "<path to IVL>/iverilog v t nemo s <top module name> o <output DOT file
-name> <netlist> <std cell netlist>"

#### Nemo Configurations ####

There are several parameters that can be configured withing Nemo to achieve
various goals. All #define configurations are located in the "nemo.h" file. The
following configurations are:

1. DEBUG_PRINTS             < true | false > - if true, include print statements
											   for debugging code 
2. INCLUDE_LOCAL_SIGNALS    < true | false > - if true, include signals 
											   generated by IVL frontend 
3. ENUMERATE_ENTIRE_CIRCUIT < true | false > - if true, create signal 
											   dependencies for entire circuit 
4. SEARCH_DEPTH             < unsigned int > - depth to search for signal 
											   dependencies
